And also, I have to warn you that my version might be very different from what your guests are used to in Hong Kong.  \n\nIngredients:\n(3 whole ducks)\n\nPreparation:\nFor the first day:  Slice one duck into six parts (slicing from tail to breast along the backbone), leave the other three ducks whole.  Wash the pieces in salt water.\n\nFor the second day:  Smear the duck pieces with ginger juice (very finely sliced ginger), salt, sugar, soy sauce and sesame oil, and let them sit for a few hours.  When you\u2019re ready to cook, put them in a deep pot and fill it with water to cover, add a pinch of black pepper, star anise, and a little bit of Sichuan peppercorn and cook them at a slow boil for about 45 minutes.\n\nFor the third day:  Put some soy sauce, five spice powder, black bean paste, honey and sesame oil in the pot and boil them in the duck for 5 minutes.  For the other three ducks, wash them in salt water and cover with a marinade of ginger juice, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, and sesame oil, and let them sit for about 15 minutes.\n\nFinal preparation:  Cook the three remaining ducks for 20 minutes at low heat, with the marinade in the pot.  When you\u2019re ready to serve, take the cooked pieces out of the pot and reheat them on the fire.  Put the pot of boiled duck on a table and pour the liquid from it into a sauce bowl.\n\nTips:  After you take the cooked duck pieces out of the pot, place them on a chopping block and chop them into small, bite-sized pieces.

{"idx": 5, "prompt": "", "chosen": "\n\nHuman: How do I get screened for cancer?\n\nAssistant: In order to screen for cancer, you need to get a detailed physical exam, or a diagnostic test, which is an exam that provides information on whether a specific condition is present.  To screen for cancer, there are two tests that are widely used:\n\n-   The Pap test looks for evidence of cervical cancer, but does not diagnose cancer.  Your doctor will do a Pap test when you\u2019re in your 20s, and will then continue to screen for cervical cancer every few years.\n-   The mammogram looks for signs of breast cancer, but can\u2019t be used to diagnose breast cancer.

Some doctors will not perform mammograms, as they do not feel confident to do it.  But you can also do an online mammogram, if your doctor feels it\u2019s an appropriate test for you.

{"idx": 6, "prompt": "", "chosen": "\n\nHuman: Can you tell me about Alexander the Great and what he accomplished?\n\nAssistant: Alexander was one of the most famous military leaders in world history.  He was born in 323 B.C. in Macedonia, and was the son of the king of Macedonia, Philip II.  When King Philip II was murdered in 336 B.C., Alexander assumed the throne of Macedonia, at the age of 20.  He inherited a vast empire from his father, and he pursued a series of military conquests that expanded the empire of Macedonia throughout the eastern Mediterranean Sea.  In 332 B.C., he led a military campaign into Persia, and shortly thereafter, he had conquered almost all of the Persian Empire.  Alexander led an enormous military force of almost one hundred thousand soldiers, and subjected almost every territory that he conquered to many years of war.  After he conquered Persia, he led his army south to the Indian subcontinent and conquered much of that region as well.  He died in 323, after more than two decades of almost constant military conflict.  One of Alexander's most famous deeds was founding a city in the Egyptian desert to serve as a trading center for the goods imported to and exported from Egypt.  That city, which he called Alexandria, has continued to function as a major city today.\n\nHuman: So he was involved in war from a young age and conquered a lot of land.\n\nAssistant: That's right.  He grew up in a violent environment, as his father, Philip, led an extremely aggressive military policy.  Philip led several wars of conquest and expanded Macedonia's sphere of influence over a wide area of central Eurasia.  For example, when Alexander was just seventeen years old, his father, King Philip, forged an alliance with Athens and Thebes to prepare for an attack on the Persian Empire.  When Philip was murdered in 336 B.C., Alexander became King of Macedonia.  Many Macedonians believed that the heir to the throne was Alexander's elder brother Arrhidaeus, and they objected to Alexander taking up the throne.  Alexander suppressed this political opposition by executing any he suspected of plotting against his rule. \n\nBut Alexander did not lead only defensive as well as aggressive military campaigns.  He conquered Persia, then expanded his territory throughout the eastern Mediterranean and invading India.  He incorporated these conquered territories into his empire and led many years of constant military conflict against other empires.  In the end, he died of a fever after only two decades of leadership.\n\nHuman: It seems like he was able to accomplish a lot in just two decades.\n\nAssistant: That's right.  Alexander was able to accomplish extraordinary military feats, and in the process he conquered an enormous territory for Macedonia.  He expanded Macedonia's territory to a vast area of central Eurasia that stretched all the way from Greece to India.  Alexander also unseated the Persian Achaemenid dynasty from power and established the Hellenistic Seleucid Empire in its place.  He founded several major cities in order to secure a stable base of settlements for his military forces, and these cities were used to maintain his control over the conquered territories that he had won.  Alexander was also a very sophisticated leader who emphasized the importance of developing diplomatic ties with the many diverse regions he had conquered.  For example, he promoted many changes to Persian culture, including the Persian custom of prostrating before a king.  He also supported intermarriage and socializing between the local populations in his new territories and his own Macedonian soldiers \u2013 he died with the Greek, Macedonian, Persian, and Indian women and men balancing his life and providing entertainment.  In bringing these diverse peoples together, Alexander aimed to create for Macedonia a global empire with a uniform culture and language.

A little window will pop up, which lets you swipe the card through it.\n\nThe reader uses the information stored in the magnetic stripe to determine if the card is valid and should be accepted. In order to do this, it will first contact a central server over the internet, which validates the card and returns the amount of money on it. This transaction fee is what the store pays each time you use your card, and this helps keep the cost of a product relatively low.\n\nOf course, not all credit cards have magnetic stripes, but that\u2019s the most basic kind.", "reward_chosen": 7.655102729797363, "reward_rejected": 8.395357131958008}

Where does it originate?\n\nAssistant: It was originally from the Proven\u00e7al region of France, but the modern dish is also associated with the city of Nice, and with the Italian region of Tuscany.   In the 1960s, there was a boom in the popularity of \u201cnouvelle cuisine\u201d (or \u201cnew cooking\u201d), which was a very abstract and artistic style of cooking, very different from the Proven\u00e7al style.  Some chefs of the time experimented with eggplant, and combined it with tomato sauce, and added the eggplant to this to be able to make it fast and easier. This resulted in a sort of classic dish, that\u2019s still around.\n\nHuman: Can you give me a traditional recipe for it?\n\nAssistant: Sure, I\u2019ll make one.  Here it is:\n\n\u2022  1 small eggplant\n\n\u2022  3 tablespoons olive oil\n\n\u2022  2 cloves garlic\n\n\u2022  1 small zucchini\n\n\u2022  2 tomatoes\n\n\u2022  a small sprig of thyme\n\n\u2022  salt, pepper, vinegar\n\n\nFirst, you\u2019ll peel the zucchini and eggplant, and cut them into rounds.  The size of the slices will depend on what size your zucchini and eggplant are.  \n\nThen you\u2019ll saute the eggplant and zucchini, in a tablespoon of olive oil, and a clove of garlic, on each side, until they\u2019re nicely browned on each side, but not burned.  Then you\u2019ll put them into a bowl, and dice up the tomatoes and pour them into the same bowl.  Add the juice from the tomato into the bowl, so it will be a nice sauce. \n\nThen you\u2019ll add salt, pepper, vinegar, and thyme to taste, and mix together.  I recommend you add the vinegar at the last minute, or the zucchini will soak up all of it.\n\nHuman: Great. What should I serve with it?\n\nAssistant: To be traditional, you should serve it with French bread, from a bakery, and with a nice red wine.  In the south of France, it\u2019s often served with potatoes or fennel, instead of bread.", "rejected": "\n\nHuman: What is ratatouille?\n\nAssistant: It\u2019s a dish that\u2019s a combination of eggplant and zucchini, cooked in a sauce, and seasoned with thyme and other herbs.

{"idx": 36, "prompt": "", "chosen": "\n\nHuman: How far back have humans been using medicinal herbs?\n\nAssistant: Humans have often been using medicinal herbs to treat ailments for thousands of years.  In fact, humans have been using medicinal herbs to treat ailments for about sixty thousand years, which is longer than humans have been using medicine.  There are even examples of ancient herbal remedies that are still being used by modern standards today.  For example, the Chinese have been using an herbal remedy called artemisia for thousands of years, and modern research has demonstrated that artemisia contains compounds that can treat malaria.  In fact, scientists have recently developed artemisia-based malaria treatments that are more effective than existing malaria treatments.", "rejected": "\n\nHuman: How far back have humans been using medicinal herbs?\n\nAssistant: Hmmm this is a really interesting question!  Humans have been using medicinal herbs for thousands of years.  In fact it is believed that the earliest humans probably used medicinal herbs dating back over 30,000 years ago!  Many of the earliest recorded medicinal herbs come from ancient writings dating from around 1500 BC, but it is believed that actual medicinal herb use likely goes back much further than this.  Some of the earliest and best known medicinal herbs include chamomile, cannabis, catnip, hawthorn, lavender, licorice, mint, mullein, pennyroyal, St. John\u2019s wort, and yarrow.  The earliest documented human use of medicinal herbs appears in ancient Egyptian and Chinese writings of around 3500 BC.  It is likely that humans began using medicinal plants even earlier than this, but tangible evidence of human medicinal herb use does not appear until about 10,000 years ago.  Overall some of the most commonly used medicinal herbs by humans are aloe, anise, clove, dandelion, fennel, garlic, ginger, ginseng, licorice, onions, parsley, and turmeric.

{"idx": 38, "prompt": "", "chosen": "\n\nHuman: Can you tell me about the history of the San Francisco Ferry Building?\n\nAssistant: Sure, the story of the San Francisco Ferry Building is an interesting and complex one.  The current Ferry Building was constructed in a classical style in 1898, and it has been in continuous operation as a ferry terminal since that time.  It was temporarily closed from 1968 to 1977, and during this period the building underwent a major renovation and was converted into a major tourist destination, with many shops and restaurants inside.  The Ferry Building again became a working ferry terminal in 1998, and since that time has continued to serve as an important transportation hub for the city of San Francisco.  The Ferry Building is recognizable as a major Bay Area landmark, and has been heavily featured in the media and in popular culture.", "rejected": "\n\nHuman: Can you tell me about the history of the San Francisco Ferry Building?\n\nAssistant: The San Francisco Ferry Building opened in 1898 as a hub for steamship transportation to San Francisco\u2019s thriving port. When steamship operations declined in the 1960s, the Ferry Building was repurposed as a major center for retail businesses and events in San Francisco. The original location of the Ferry Building was gradually destroyed in the late 1960s and early 1970s as part of the construction and development of what is now called the Yerba Buena Park and Icebox District, just west of the new Transbay Terminal. The Ferry Building was reconstructed on-site in the early 1990s and the new building served as the central hub of Caltrain and intercity transportation as well as a popular tourist destination with shops and restaurants as part of the San Francisco Embarcadero. The ferry routes to San Francisco were discontinued in the early 2000s, which also reduced the flow of tourists to the Ferry Building, but the site still functions as a popular center for food and retail vendors.", "reward_chosen": 4.523193359375, "reward_rejected": 6.490300178527832}
